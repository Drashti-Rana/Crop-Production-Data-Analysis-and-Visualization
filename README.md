# Crop-Production-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to analyze crop production data to identify patterns and trends across different regions and seasons. The analysis is performed using Python for data manipulation and visualization, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards.
## Data Cleaning
The data cleaning steps include:
- Loading the data from a CSV file.
- Converting columns to appropriate data types.
- Handling missing values by removing rows with null or zero production.
- Standardizing categorical values (e.g., season names).
## Data Analysis
The analysis covers various aspects of crop production, including:
- Summary statistics and data exploration.
- Grouping data by different categories such as crop, state, and year.
- Pivot tables for summarizing production across different dimensions.
## Visualizations
### Python Visualizations
- Bar charts for yearly crop production by state.
- Pie charts for state-wise production distribution.
- Heatmaps for season-wise production over the years.
### Power BI Dashboard
- Overview Page: Total production by year and top 5 states.
- Detailed Analysis Page: Yearly production by state and crop, pie charts, and maps.
- Seasonal Analysis Page: Heatmaps and season trend comparisons.
- Crop-Specific Analysis: Detailed breakdowns and trends.
